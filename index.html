          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Karol Dwojak, a .NET Developer with a passion for all
            kind of activities. I specialize in C#. I worked on projects
            focusing on Desktop and Web API (Modular Monolith) architectures
            with a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) pattern for Web API projects.
            Recently, I resumed my master's degree studies after a few years'
            break, and I lead an active lifestyle, working out 2-3 times a week.
            I'm also a fan of bicycles and airshipts, balancing my time between
            work, study, and my hobbies.

            <p>
              - Warehouse management system (WMS) - monitor and manipulate
              devices around the warehouse (PLC, AGVs),<br />

              warehouse

                (WMS)<br />
                I was responsible for the system's key communication with
                external systems (ERP, robot fleet manager, AGVs) through the
                use of EF Core, SQL routines, MassTransit, with PLC devices
                running in the warehouse using RabbitMQ and MQTT and with the
                auto refresh frontend through SignalR I developed an internal
                generic configurable validator for both technical and business
                rules by combining several design patterns, improving
                scalability and the ability to use validation in parallel I
                developed integration tests (nUnit) and unit tests (xUnit) in
                combination with the creation of Fixtures using Moq I introduced
                and developed the Outbox pattern and distribution of events in
                the system I introduced and Alert Generator as a subsystem,
                improving the client about the problem of data synchronisation
                by other systems connected to ours Working with Jira and
                Bookstack for CI/CD we used Jenkins in combination with Docker
                containerisation. <br />
                <br />

                (Terminal-like)<br />
                I was responsible for setting up communication with a legacy ERP
                system, using SQL procedures, Entity Framework Core. I created a
                user action tracking module by collecting information about the
                actions performed by the user. I stored the information in an
                XML structure, the solution improved the tracking by catching
                user errors thus improving error fixing. The application was
                made in a modular monolith architecture approach use(.NET 6).

                I worked with legacy code and migrated code to the latest
                version of .NET Framework 4.8 I created add-ons to existing
                software modules (using Xamarin, WPF), with database maintenance
                by using NHibernate and unit testing with the MSTests framework.
                I automated the modernisation process of the application using
                Powershell and XML configuration. I developed an authentication
                migration service using SQLite and XML for additional mapping
                setup and migration configuration. I developed a learning
                application for new employees using .NET Core 3.1, Entity
                Framework and SQL. I mentored new employees. I worked with
                Redmine, later switching to Jira and Confluence for CI/CD we
                used Jenkins and Teamcity.

                I was developing the use of Azure, including support for file
                management. The backend was hosted on Azure as a BAAS (backend
                as a service). I developed modules responsible for organisation
                and user management using RESTful CRUD, Entity Framework Core. I
                created tests among others unit and end to end - only with fake
                data (without using moq) using nUnit (end ot end) and xUnit
                (unit). I developed Event Sourcing for user maintenance. I have
                worked with ClickUp, Redmine, Azure Storage and Azure Pipelines
