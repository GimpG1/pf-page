            <h3>SOFTWARE ENGINEER</h3>
            <p>
              - Warehouse management system (WMS) - monitor and manipulate
              devices around the warehouse (PLC, AGVs), communicate with
              customers ERP,<br />
              - Terminal-like RESTful WebApi - organisation of work on the
              warehouse
            </p>
            <div class="hidden-details" style="display: none">
              <h5>Terminal Application</h5>
              <p class="portfolio-details">
                As part of the WMS software, I was responsible for synchronizing
                data with the ERP system using an
                <strong>XML ACL layer</strong>. This involved configuring and
                setting up <strong>XML</strong> files to ensure seamless data
                integration. I created generic <strong>XML</strong> generator
                generate xml only by given object to the mehanism.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h5>Alerts Module</h5>
              <p class="portfolio-details">
                I developed this module to notify supervisors via email and
                other system users of important events. It also included a
                safety alarm feature for the warehouse, which automatically
                halts all robotic operations to allow for maintenance or
                troubleshooting when someone enters the warehouse.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h5>RoboticsConnector Module</h5>
              <p class="portfolio-details">
                I developed the entire module, which included translating
                locations from a preconfigured warehouse map, automatically
                refreshing robot locations using <strong>SignalR</strong> for
                the frontend, and integrating <strong>RabbitMQ</strong> to read
                these locations. Additionally, the module was responsible for
                creating various transport missions in the robots' external
                mission software. This module also included unit and integration
                tests.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h5>ErpConnector Module</h5>
              <p class="portfolio-details">
                I developed the part of this module responsible for validating
                customer data. My implementation used the
                <strong>strategy design pattern</strong> to handle data
                validation, ensuring that unwanted or duplicate data (which
                could be sent by customers via <strong>SQL</strong>
                procedures) did not enter the WMS.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h5>PLC Message Broker</h5>
              <p class="portfolio-details">
                To manage the frequent calls (every second) from PLC devices to
                <strong>RabbitMQ</strong>, I implemented an
                <strong>outbox pattern</strong>. This ensured that duplicate
                messages were not processed by our WMS, maintaining data
                integrity.
              </p>
              <br />

              <h5>Workflow</h5>
              <p class="portfolio-details">
                In both projects we used to work with modular monolith
                architecture combined with domain driven design. Working in
                scrum methodology with Jira and Bookstack. For CI/CD we used
                Jenkins in combination with Docker containerisation.
